This repository contains a set of functions to analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report statistics such as the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. The data can be reordered from largest to smallest, and the statistics are printed to the screen in a nicely formatted presentation.


The `stats.c` file contains the implementation of the following functions:

1. `print_array(data, size)`: Given an array of data and a length, this function prints the array to the screen.
2. `print_statistics(data, size)`: This function prints the statistics of the data array, including the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values.
3. `find_median(data, size)`: Given an array of data and a length, this function returns the median value.
4. `find_mean(data, size)`: Given an array of data and a length, this function returns the mean value.
5. `find_maximum(data, size)`: Given an array of data and a length, this function returns the maximum value.
6. `find_minimum(data, size)`: Given an array of data and a length, this function returns the minimum value.
7. `sort_array(data, size)`: Given an array of data and a length, this function sorts the array from largest to smallest.
